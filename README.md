# Trefusis Engine - Newcomer Contributors Guide!

Hey you! Finally awake! This is the TrefusisEngine, our small in-house game engine wannabe full of memory leaks and occasional runaway bug that will screetch until it gets you. Since we are in early days of development, not all is settled, but here is what you should do: Install the requirements, DO NOT change the CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory, or if you do, branch the repo so we can test it properly, and just start coding.

## Requirments

### SDL Requirments

You will need libsdl, libsdl_ttf and libsdl_image to make the repository compile properly.

### Harlequin Requirments

Harlequin, our inhouse scripting engine currently requires Python. Just make seure your PYTHONPATH is set!


## Needs! Styles! Standards!

Here in ProjectAras we adhere to a strict st-- na, just kidding, if you want a style standard tho, try to use Google's C++ style guide. You don't have to know it, none of us, infact do, but it is nice practice to keep things concise.

## DOCUMENTATION

Please document your code man. Also leave some good messages to the Issue about Documention, we cannot seem to shut that down.
